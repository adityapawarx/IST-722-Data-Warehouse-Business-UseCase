# **ETL Pipeline for FudgeMart_v-3 | Data Warehousing & Business Intelligence**

## **Project Overview**  
This project involves designing and implementing an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using **Snowflake, DBT (Data Build Tool), and GitHub** to transform the **FudgeMart_v-3** database into a structured and optimized **data warehouse**. The goal is to enhance data quality, improve accessibility, and support business intelligence through **data modeling, automation, and visualization**. The project follows a structured approach, including **data profiling, schema design, ETL process automation, and dashboard creation in Tableau**. The final output enables data-driven decision-making by delivering **clean, structured, and insightful business data**.

## **Project Background**  
In this project, we developed a **data warehouse solution** for the **FudgeMart_v-3 database**, a retail business dataset. The pipeline integrates **raw transactional data**, processes it using **DBT transformations**, and loads it into **Snowflake**, ensuring efficient querying and reporting. Key components of the project include:
- **Extracting raw data** from different sources.  
- **Transforming data** through **dimensional modeling (star schema)** to optimize analytical performance.  
- **Automating ETL workflows** using **DBT & SQL scripts** to streamline data updates.  
- **Visualizing insights** with **Tableau dashboards** for business intelligence reporting.

## **Data Pipeline Architecture**  
The **ETL pipeline** follows this structured approach:
1. **Extract** â†’ Load raw transactional, inventory, and customer data into Snowflake.  
2. **Transform** â†’ Apply **data cleaning, standardization, and schema modeling** using DBT.  
3. **Load** â†’ Store the transformed data into the Snowflake **data warehouse**, optimized for analytics.  
4. **Analyze** â†’ Use **SQL queries & Tableau dashboards** to generate insights.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Snowflake** â†’ Cloud-based data warehousing solution.  
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)** â†’ Automates data transformations and modeling.  
- **SQL (Structured Query Language)** â†’ Used for writing queries and transformations.  
- **GitHub** â†’ Version control and collaboration.  
- **Tableau** â†’ Business Intelligence (BI) tool for data visualization.  
- **Python (for scripting)** â†’ Handling additional data processing tasks.

## **Key Features**  
âœ… **Automated ETL Workflow** â€“ DBT ensures seamless transformation and scheduling of ETL processes.  
âœ… **Optimized Data Warehouse** â€“ Dimensional modeling improves query performance.  
âœ… **Scalable & Maintainable Pipeline** â€“ Designed to handle large-scale datasets efficiently.  
âœ… **Business Insights Dashboard** â€“ Tableau provides an intuitive interface for decision-making.

## **Data Modeling & Schema Design**  
- **Fact Table:** Stores transactional data (sales, purchases, revenue).  
- **Dimension Tables:** Contains information about products, customers, and store locations.  
- **Schema Type:** **Star Schema** â€“ Optimized for analytical performance.  

### **Bus Matrix for Data Warehouse Design:**  
| Business Process | Fact Table | Dimensions |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Sales Analysis | Sales_Fact | Date, Customer, Product, Store |
| Inventory Tracking | Inventory_Fact | Date, Product, Store |
| Customer Behavior | Customer_Fact | Date, Customer, Product |

---

## **Business Intelligence & Visualization**  
ðŸ“Š **Tableau Dashboard** â€“ Displays key business KPIs, including:
- **Sales Trends** â€“ Revenue breakdown by region, product category, and customer segments.  
- **Customer Insights** â€“ Retention, purchase patterns, and lifetime value analysis.  
- **Inventory Monitoring** â€“ Stock levels, replenishment needs, and product demand trends.
